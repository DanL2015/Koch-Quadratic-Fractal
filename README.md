# Koch-Quadratic
UPDATE:
Started learning HTML/Javascript.
Recreated project using Canvas in HTML.
New files are: "index.html" "canvas.js" "style.css".
The "main.cpp" file is an old C++/SFML one.


Koch Quadratic Curve using C++ with SFML for graphics
I just started self-learing SFML a few weeks ago and this was a fun way to test my skill I guess.
Fractals are pretty cool too.
